# Simple-calculator
Calculator supporting 4 basic arithmetical operations, brackets and percentage.
When dealing with large numbers it rounds them and uses power of 10 which makes the number step out from its original value and also 
operations with double type are used so decimal places for results after arithmetical operations will have their limit of usage.
